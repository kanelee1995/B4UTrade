## Difficulties faced

### Design & Layout
- Choosing the style of the landing page. For the finanical section website, some of them tend to use "Successful real person in suit" kind of background, while cartoon and flat design is trending too. 
- I finally choose the flat design as that could provide possibility to animate the svg, which providing more enjoyable visual experience.
- Using AI to seperate the parts and taking out what is useful.
- Choosing fonts for Landing page layout to archieve UI aesthetics.

### Components
- Finding a perfect API for all the data is not accessable, therefore I used 4 different APIs to suit my needs.
